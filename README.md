# LanguageLearning

## Project Description

LanguageLearning provides resources and example code for building tools that make learning new languages more engaging. The repository is organized to eventually contain flashcard generators, pronunciation helpers, and interactive practice scripts.

## Setup Requirements

To get started, you will need:

- Python 3.10+
- `pip` for managing packages

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/example/LanguageLearning.git
cd LanguageLearning
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Examples

Once dependencies are installed, you can run the main script to start a practice session:

```bash
python main.py --language spanish
```

The application will guide you through vocabulary and grammar exercises in your chosen language.
